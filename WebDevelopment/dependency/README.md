### Rest API - https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/
The WordPress REST API provides an interface for applications to interact with your WordPress site by sending and receiving data as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. The REST API is a developer-oriented feature of WordPress. It provides data access to the content of your site, and implements the same authentication restrictions â€” content that is public on your site is generally publicly accessible via the REST API, while private content, password-protected content, internal users, custom post types, and metadata is only available with authentication or if you specifically set it to be so.
